# DNS Operationalization Report – 15 April 2026 (Final Version)

## Background
The Divergence Navigation System (DNS) provides a theoretical framework for epistemic robustness. However, earlier test runs (Runde 1–3) revealed a critical flaw: when agents (LLMs) are exposed to protocol details (Δdiv, smoothing, drift), they abandon the content and enter meta-discussions about DNS itself. This frame drift made the method unusable for learners and practitioners.

## Objective
Operationalize DNS into a practical, EU AI Act-compliant method that can be used by students, teachers, and administrators – without any knowledge of the underlying protocol.

## Solution: Two-Layer Architecture

**Frontend – Four Questions Method**
1. On topic? 🟢 / 🔴
2. New idea? 🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴
3. Verifiable? (number, date, place, if-then) 🟢 / 🔴
4. Understandable? 👍 / 👎

Good answer = 🟢 + 🟢 + 👍

**Backend – Safety Layer**
| Component | Function | AI Act |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Bias detection (SHAP) | Marks yellow when protected feature >25% | Art. 13 |
| Formal dissent | Justification ≥140 chars for deviation | Art. 14 |
| Audit trail | Merkle root + IPFS, daily salts | Art. 9, 15, 19 |

DSGVO-compliant: no personal profiles, only session hashes (Art. 89).

## Interventions-Trigger

1. **Q3 Verifiability → 🔴**: Stop. "Add a concrete detail."
2. **Q1 Topic → 🔴**: Reset. "Back to the original question."
3. **Q2 New idea → 🔴**: Elaborate. "Give example or counter-point."

No judgment, no grades, no meta-discussion.

## Implementation Artifacts (v2.1)
- Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19597808
- GitHub: https://github.com/schltdns/divergence-navigation-system
- IPFS: bafkreiblue2cs6e4xmpbpklkswimpzgnoumszgkvcm5csukdiqhqkf7wyy

## Key Lessons
1. Agents must never see the protocol
2. Human operator is irreplaceable
3. Dual licensing protects method
4. IPFS + SHA256 replaces blockchain

## Next Steps
- Montessori pilot NRW (after Easter)
- Legal validation (Inge Seher)
- IHK Bonn integration
- Case study publication
