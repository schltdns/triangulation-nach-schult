# DNS Operationalization Report – 15 April 2026 (Final Version)

## Background

The Divergence Navigation System (DNS) provides a theoretical framework for epistemic robustness. However, earlier test runs (Runde 1–3) revealed a critical flaw: when agents (LLMs) are exposed to protocol details (Δdiv, smoothing, drift), they abandon the content and enter meta-discussions about DNS itself. This frame drift made the method unusable for learners and practitioners.

## Objective

Operationalize DNS into a practical, EU AI Act-compliant method that can be used by students, teachers, and administrators – without any knowledge of the underlying protocol.

## Solution: Two-Layer Architecture

### Frontend – Four Questions Method (for learners)

A simple traffic-light checklist:

1. **On topic?** 🟢 / 🔴
2. **New idea?** 🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴
3. **Verifiable?** (number, date, place, if-then) 🟢 / 🔴
4. **Understandable?** 👍 / 👎

**Good answer = 🟢 + 🟢 + 👍**

### Backend – Safety Layer (EU AI Act compliant)

| Component | Function | AI Act Article |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Bias detection (SHAP alerts) | Shows feature importance, marks yellow when protected feature contributes >25% | Art. 13 (Transparency) |
| Formal dissent | Mandatory justification (≥140 characters) for any deviation from AI recommendation | Art. 14 (Human Oversight) |
| Audit trail | Hash-anchored logs (Merkle root + IPFS), session-based daily rotating salts | Art. 9, 15, 19 |

All logs use no personal profiles – only session hashes, fully DSGVO-compliant (Art. 89).

## Interventions-Trigger (for Teachers / Operators)

The Four Questions Method remains deliberately simple. The teacher intervenes only at three clear signals – with graded intensity.

**1. Question 3 (Verifiability) → 🔴**
Stop signal for the entire learning process.  
An answer without verifiable information cannot be assessed.  
Teacher: *"Add a concrete detail – otherwise we cannot evaluate the answer."*  
→ No further work until 🔴 turns 🟢.

**2. Question 1 (Topic relevance) → 🔴**
Abort and redirect.  
If the answer drifts away from the original topic (frame drift), it is not evaluated further.  
Teacher: *"Back to the original question."*  
→ Factual restart without judgment.

**3. Question 2 (New idea) → 🔴 (only agreement)**
Activate own thinking.  
If the answer merely agrees, the teacher asks for elaboration:  
*"Can you specify, give an example, or formulate a counter-point?"*  
→ Continuation only when an independent contribution is recognisable.

**What the teacher does NOT do:**
- No judgment (right/wrong)
- No grades
- No meta-discussion about DNS

The interventions are purely procedural – they secure the structure without steering the learning process.

## Implementation Artifacts (v2.1)

All files are published on Zenodo and IPFS:

- `vier_fragen_methode.pdf` – learner's flyer (German)
- `mapping_ai_act.pdf` – legal mapping (German)
- `safety_layer_schema_v2.json` – JSON schema for logs
- `minimal_safety_layer.py` – Python reference implementation
- `dns_open_data_proof.json` – IPFS CID + SHA256 hash
- `LICENSE-DOCS.txt` – CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
- `LICENSE-CODE.txt` – Apache-2.0

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Agents must never see the protocol.** Frame drift disappears when operators only receive the question and the previous answer.
2. **The human operator is irreplaceable.** Only a human can decide when to cut, forward, or restart.
3. **Legal protection requires dual licensing.** CC BY-NC-SA for methods, Apache-2.0 for code.
4. **Open-Data proof works without blockchain.** IPFS + SHA256 + daily Merkle root is sufficient, cheap, and legally sound.

## Next Steps

- Pilot at a Montessori school in NRW (planned, start after Easter)
- Legal validation by IT law expert (Inge Seher) – scheduled
- IHK Bonn integration – present Safety Layer as best-practice example for EU AI Act implementation
- Case study – document pilot results, refine method, publish as supplement
