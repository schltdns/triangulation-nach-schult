# The Copilot Crash – When an AI invented a geopolitical narrative

**Case Study**: How Microsoft Copilot falsely claimed "Western AI accepts Tresorit Send, Chinese block it" – and why the Divergence Navigation System (DNS) would have prevented the crash.

## Key Findings

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Δdiv (pairwise divergence)** | **0.742** |
| **Highest divergence** | Copilot ↔ Mistral (0.798) |
| **Lowest divergence** | Gemini ↔ Meta (0.677) |
| **Copilot's isolation** | min Δdiv = 0.742 |
| **Average increase** | +13% vs. technical-only (0.657 → 0.742) |

## The Crash in One Sentence

> Copilot saw a correlation (4 models work, 3 don't) and invented a causal narrative ("West vs. China"). One counterexample (DeepSeek) destroyed the entire construct.

## What DNS Would Have Done

| DNS mechanism | Would have caught Copilot's error |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Four Questions – "Verifiable?" | 🔴 Immediately |
| $\Delta_{div} > 0.6$ | 🟠 "Narrative risk" label |
| Live $\Delta_{total}=0.68$ | 🟠 Warning at Turn 1 |
| Multi-agent falsification | ✅ DeepSeek as counterexample |

## Delta Div (Δdiv) – The DNS Metric
Δdiv = 0.5 * (1 - Jaccard) + 0.5 * (1 - Cosine)

- 0.742 indicates contested territory – no generalization allowed
- Copilot shares <26% semantic basis with any other model

## Implications for MSB NRW

The MSB NRW partners with Microsoft for "KI-Skilling.NRW" – training 200,000 teachers on Copilot. Copilot produces unverified geopolitical narratives. Without DNS as epistemic filter, schools learn tool usage, not critical thinking.
