# 04_divergence_map.md – Divergence Map: Cognitive Safety Hypothesis

**Run:** dns_v2.1_cognitive_safety  
**Date:** 2026-04-18  

## Overview

All six models confirm the core hypothesis. Divergence occurs in **framing, emphasis, and operational details**, not in the fundamental mechanism.

## Divergence Types

### 1. Substantive Divergence (factual disagreements)

| Issue | Model A | Model B | Resolution |
|-------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Immunisation risk** | ChatGPT: "DNS scheitert nicht" is non-falsifiable | DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok: Statement is acceptable as tool property | Operator decided to keep statement but add caveat (see [05b_operator_decision.md](./05b_operator_decision.md)) |
| **Operator failure vs. design failure** | ChatGPT: Design can amplify/dampen operator failure | Others: Failure is exclusively operator error | Synthesised as: "DNS is robust; primary failure mode is operator, but design matters" |

### 2. Normative Divergence (value-based differences)

| Issue | Model A | Model B | Type |
|-------|---------|---------|------|
| **Universality** | ChatGPT: Not universal | Gemini: Broadly applicable | Risk tolerance |
| **Neurodivergence as origin** | Claude: Origin is geopolitics, son is application | Grok: Son is emotionally central | Emphasis |
| **Target group definition** | DeepSeek: "People with high evaluation anxiety" | Gemini: "Neurodivergent and introverted" | Scope |

### 3. Architectural Divergence (bias due to training)

- **ChatGPT** → reviewer mode, precision-focused  
- **Claude** → philosophical, depth-oriented  
- **DeepSeek** → falsification, strictness  
- **Gemini** → visionary, manifesto-like  
- **Grok** → direct, unvarnished  
- **Copilot** → synthesising, bridging  

No resolution needed – these are documented as epistemic diversity.

## Divergence Matrix

| Dimension | ChatGPT | Claude | DeepSeek | Gemini | Grok | Copilot | Consensus |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------|--------|------|---------|-----------|
| Core mechanism confirmed | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **High** |
| Social decoupling works | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **High** |
| Neurodivergence relevance | ✅ (conditional) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **High** |
| Universal applicability | ⚠️ (limited) | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Medium** |
| Operator failure only | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Medium** |
| Empirical proof needed | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **High** |

## Estimated Δdiv (Preliminary)

**Current value: ≈0.25–0.35** (low to medium divergence)

> **Note:** This value is a **qualitative estimate** based on the divergence matrix. A precise, reproducible calculation of Δdiv using Jaccard and cosine similarity on the actual model outputs (see `03_outputs/`) will be performed later with a Python script. The result will replace this estimate.

Based on the divergence matrix, all models agree on the core; differences are in nuance and framing. This is below the high‑divergence threshold (>0.6).

## Implications for Synthesis

- A **consensus synthesis** is possible (see [05_synthesis.md](./05_synthesis.md)).
- Contradictions are documented but do not invalidate the hypothesis.
- The operator decision log ([05b_operator_decision.md](./05b_operator_decision.md)) resolves the normative divergences.
