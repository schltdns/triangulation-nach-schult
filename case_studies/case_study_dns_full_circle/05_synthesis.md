# 05_synthesis.md – Synthesis of Model Responses

**Run:** dns_v2.1_full_circle  
**Date:** 2025-12-18  

## Core Consensus (All Models)

The following statements are supported by all six models (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Copilot):

1. **Mechanism:** DNS is a method for navigating divergence across multiple LLMs, not a single-model prompting technique. It structures disagreement rather than resolving it through averaging.

2. **Architecture:** DNS operates through a defined multi-phase protocol (hypothesis → model selection → divergence mapping → synthesis → validation).

3. **Metric:** Divergence is quantified as Δdiv = 0.5 × (1 - Jaccard) + 0.5 × (1 - Cosine), with thresholds distinguishing convergent, structured, and contested outputs.

4. **Human role:** Synthesis is performed by a human operator, not by the models. DNS provides the divergence map; the operator provides the judgment.

5. **Purpose:** DNS aims to preserve epistemic diversity while enabling falsifiable, auditable knowledge synthesis.

## Conditionally Supported Statements (with caveats)

| Statement | Supporting models | Caveat / Dissent |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| DNS has four levels | ChatGPT, Grok | Claude, DeepSeek describe eight phases instead of four levels – terminology differs but structure aligns |
| DNS is primarily theoretical | Claude, Gemini | DeepSeek and Copilot emphasize operational implementation over theory |
| Origin in geopolitical analysis | Claude | Other models do not mention origin; focus on current method |
| arXiv readiness requires LaTeX compliance | Copilot | Other models prioritize conceptual clarity over formatting |

## Rejected or Contested Statements

- **"DNS eliminates bias":** No model claimed this. All six emphasized that DNS makes bias visible but does not remove it. Operator decisions remain the critical failure point.
- **"All models describe DNS identically":** Falsified by Δdiv = 0.8142. The six descriptions are structurally incompatible at the vocabulary level.

## Divergence Quantification

The calculated Δdiv for this case study is **0.8142** (contested divergence). This value reflects genuine perspective fragmentation – architecture vs. protocol vs. theory vs. operations – not random noise. All six models independently confirmed the core mechanism listed above despite using non-overlapping terminology.

See [04_divergence_map.md](./04_divergence_map.md) for the full divergence matrix and interpretation.

## Final Formulation of the Hypothesis (Approved by All Models)

> **DNS is a divergence navigation system that quantifies disagreement across multiple LLMs (Δdiv), preserves epistemic diversity through structured protocols, and requires human synthesis to produce falsifiable knowledge claims.**

## Guiding Principle (Claude)

> *"DNS does not resolve divergence. It makes divergence usable."*

## Remaining Open Questions (for Empirical Testing)

- Does Δdiv > 0.78 reliably predict synthesis difficulty across domains?
- Can operator decisions (D1–D6) be standardized without losing context sensitivity?
- How does DNS perform when applied to non-textual divergence (images, code, data)?
