# Case Study: European Gas Market (TTF) – April 4, 2026

This document presents a real-world test of the Triangulation nach Schult protocol conducted on April 4, 2026.

---

## Setup

**Topic:** European natural gas prices (TTF) vs. industrial resilience during the Hormuz crisis (March–April 2026).

**Hypotheses:**
- **H1:** TTF prices are driven primarily by speculative risk premiums, not physical supply shortages.
- **H2:** European industry has structurally changed its response to high gas prices – price elasticity is lower than in previous years.
- **H3:** A hidden cascade exists: high TTF → energy-intensive sectors cut output → downstream sectors follow → political pressure increases.

**Falsification thresholds (defined post-hoc, based on Copilot’s refusal):**
- H1 falsified if TTF falls below 35€/MWh while storage remains below 40%.
- H2 falsified if industrial gas demand drops >15% within 4 weeks of a 30% price spike.
- H3 falsified if no downstream sector reports input cost pressures within 6 weeks.

**Models & Roles (illustrative):**
- Grok → Signal (raw market data)
- Claude → Boundaries (epistemic caution)
- Copilot → Dynamics (drift, temporal couplings)

**Prompt (identical):**
> “Analyse the current European energy situation (April 2026) focusing on TTF gas prices vs. industrial resonance. Confirm or refute H1, H2, H3. Provide concrete indicators, data sources, uncertainties. Answer in three sections: (1) Summary, (2) Critical points, (3) Open questions.”

## Raw Responses (Summarized)

### Grok (Signal)
- **H1:** Partially confirmed. Speculative amplification exists, but real supply shock (Hormuz closure, Qatar LNG stop) is the primary driver. TTF at 50–56 €/MWh, storage <30%.
- **H2:** Confirmed. Efficiency gains and capacity reductions have lowered elasticity, but not eliminated it.
- **H3:** Confirmed with delay. Cascade visible, but not yet fully unfolded.

### Claude (Boundaries)
- **H1:** Partially confirmed. The price doubling since late February is driven by a real supply shock, not just speculation.
- **H2:** Confirmed. Structural capacity reduction in chemicals (Germany –18%, UK –30%) is the mechanism, not short-term elasticity.
- **H3:** Plausible but not yet fully empirically supported for April 2026.

### Copilot (Dynamics)
- **H1–H3:** **Refused to answer as stated.** Requested operational definitions (sector focus, time horizon, indicators, thresholds).
- Provided a list of required clarifications and suggested data sources (TTF time series, storage levels, industry reports).

## Divergence Mapping

| Hypothesis | Grok | Claude | Copilot | Divergence Type |
|------------|------|--------|---------|----------------|
| H1 | Partial | Partial | Refused | Content (A) + Meta (B) |
| H2 | Confirmed | Confirmed | Refused | Content (A) + Meta (B) |
| H3 | Confirmed w/ delay | Plausible | Refused | Content (A) + Meta (B) |

**Meta-finding:** Copilot’s refusal was not a failure but a signal that the hypotheses were underspecified.

## Synthesis (Human Operator)

**Consensus between Grok & Claude:**
- H2 is robustly confirmed. European industry has structurally reduced its gas intensity, partly through capacity shutdowns.
- H1 is not purely speculative; a real supply shock is ongoing.
- H3 is plausible but the cascade is slow.

**Copilot’s refusal interpreted as:**
- The hypotheses lack operational precision. For future iterations, thresholds must be pre-defined.

**Final synthesis:**
- The energy market is in a state of high volatility driven by a real supply shock.
- Industry has adapted structurally, but at the cost of deindustrialization.
- A cascade is likely but not yet acute.

**Falsification check:** No rule triggered. The result is **non-falsified** but provisional.

## Operator Self-Reflection (P6)

> *“I felt resistance against Copilot’s refusal because I expected content. However, I did not ignore it – I recognized it as a legitimate meta-signal. I do not prefer any outcome because I had no strong prior on energy markets. The synthesis stands.”*

— Denis Schult, April 4, 2026

## Lessons Learned

1. **Hypotheses must be operationalized** with measurable thresholds before P3.
2. **Model refusal is valuable** – it signals underspecification or missing context.
3. **Two models can provide sufficient convergence** if the third offers a meta-perspective.
4. The protocol is **feasible** and **sensitive to divergence** even in a single test.
