# Triangulation nach Schult (TNS) — v1.0‑Open

**"Divergence is a signal, not noise."** A formal multi‑agent protocol for decision‑making, AI evaluation, and uncertainty mapping using Large Language Models (LLMs).  
**Divergence > Consensus.**

---

## 🎯 Why TNS Exists
Most AI evaluation frameworks try to *reduce* disagreement (e.g., voting, averaging, ensemble methods).  
But because modern LLMs share training data, alignment norms, and structural biases, **consensus often hides systemic error**.

When multiple models confidently agree on a falsehood, the error becomes invisible.

**TNS reverses the logic:** Disagreement, drift, refusal, and contradiction are treated as *primary analytical signals*.

---

## 🚀 What TNS Does
TNS provides a **6‑phase operational protocol** that transforms conflicting AI outputs into a structured, falsifiable, human‑led synthesis.

The method is:
- **model‑agnostic** - **falsifiable** (explicit thresholds)  
- **recursive** - **didactically applicable** - **open‑source** - **human‑in‑the‑loop by design**

TNS does **not** aim for consensus.  
It aims for **epistemic stability under divergence**.

---

## 🔬 Novelty Claim
TNS is distinct from classical triangulation (Denzin, Patton), Delphi methods, ensemble learning, or multi‑agent debate systems because it:

1. **Operationalizes divergence** as a structured data layer.  
2. Uses **role‑based model decomposition** (Signal, Structure, Boundaries, Falsification, Dynamics, Critique).  
3. Applies **explicit falsification thresholds**.  
4. Requires **mandatory human justification** for synthesis.  
5. Includes **operator self‑reflection** to detect human bias.

# 🛠 The 6‑Phase TNS Protocol (P1–P6)

### **P1 — Hypotheses & Falsification**
Define hypotheses and measurable falsification thresholds.  
*Example: “If Gas Price > 50€, H1 is false.”*

### **P2 — Team Architecture**
Assign functional roles to diverse models:  
**Signal • Structure • Boundaries • Falsification • Dynamics • Critique**

### **P3 — Parallel Elicitation**
Send the **same prompt** to all models. No cross‑contamination. No iterative debate.

### **P4 — Divergence Mapping**
Categorize contradictions: content/methodological divergence, bias signals, blind spots, or refusals.

### **P5 — Weighted Human Synthesis**
The operator integrates findings and must justify inclusions/exclusions and how divergence informed the result.

### **P6 — Operator Self‑Reflection**
A mandatory 3‑question check:
1. *Did I prefer the model that matched my prior belief?* 2. *Did I ignore a divergence because it was inconvenient?* 3. *Would another operator reach the same synthesis?*

📚 Real‑World Case Study
Energy Market 2026 — Hormuz Crisis (TTF Gas) Models used: Grok (Signal), Claude (Boundaries), Copilot (Dynamics).

Outcome:

Identified a structural shift from speculation → supply‑driven volatility.

A model refusal revealed an underspecified hypothesis.

Divergence mapping exposed hidden assumptions in the initial scenario.

📥 Quick Start
Define 3 hypotheses and set falsification thresholds.

Run the same prompt through 3+ LLMs.

Map divergence — ignore consensus initially.

Perform the operator reflection (P6).

Consensus can obscure systemic risk. Divergence reveals structure.
