# DNS v2.1
# DNS — Divergence Navigation System

**DNS does not reduce uncertainty — it makes it visible.**

> For classrooms and practice: four questions, traffic light, done.  
> For research: measurable divergence (Δdiv), auditable under EU AI Act.

### The Four Questions Method
Check every LLM answer:

1. **On topic?** 🟢 / 🔴
2. **New idea?** 🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴
3. **Verifiable?** (number, date, place, if-then) 🟢 / 🔴
4. **Understandable?** 👍 / 👎

**Good answer = 🟢 + 🟢 + 👍**

No account. No API. Works on paper.  
→ `teaching/four_questions_method.pdf`

### Why this works
- Teachers keep human oversight (AI Act Art. 14)
- Students filter hallucinations
- Decision makers see where models disagree

## What DNS is technically

**Core metric Δdiv**
Δdiv = 0.5 × (1 - Jaccard) + 0.5 × (1 - Cosine)
- 0.05 = convergence
- 0.62 = structured divergence
- 0.78 = contested

**Two layers**
- Frontend: Four Questions
- Backend: Safety Layer (JSON schema, hash anchors, SHAP)

## EU AI Act mapping

| Art. 13 Transparency | Four Questions documented |
| Art. 14 Human oversight | Operator justifies synthesis |
| Art. 15 Robustness | Δdiv + falsification rules |

## Quick start
1. Read `docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md`
2. Use `safety_layer_schema_v2.json`
3. Run `minimal_safety_layer.py`
